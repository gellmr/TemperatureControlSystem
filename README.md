### Specifications:

The system should monitor the temperature of the room.

Allow all aspects of the system to be configured using variables.

Light different LEDs depending on the temperature.

Sound an alarm if it is too hot.

Implement an alarm reset system using a code sequence from button presses.

Print out an array of information on request of a button press, including temperature in K, C, F, and system state.

Activate a fan through a transistor to cool the system down if it gets above a certain temperature.

Use different fan speeds depending on the temperature by pulsing the fan.

Use a potentiometer as a calibration mechanism.

It should only work when the lights are on, using a LDR.
